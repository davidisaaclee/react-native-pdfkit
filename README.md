# react-native-pdfkit

React Native wrapper around some Apple PDFKit APIs

> I made this wrapper for a specific use case - you'd probably be better off using something like [`react-native-pdf`](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf).

## Installation


```sh
npm install react-native-pdfkit
```


## Usage
See the [example app](./example).
